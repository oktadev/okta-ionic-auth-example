# Ionic App with Okta Authentication

This example shows how to create an Ionic application that uses Cordova's in-app browser to log in with Okta.

Please read [Build an Ionic App with User Authentication](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/08/22/build-an-ionic-app-with-user-authentication) to see how this application was created.

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oktadeveloper/okta-ionic-auth-example.git
cd okta-ionic-auth-example
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. Then run the following command to install Ionic and Cordova.

```
npm install -g cordova ionic
```

Then run the application:

```
npm install
ionic serve
```

To integrate Okta's Identity Platform for user authentication, you'll first need to:

* [Register](https://www.okta.com/developer/signup/) and create an OIDC application
* Log in to your Okta account and navigate to **Applications > Add Application** 
* Select **SPA** and click **Next**
* Give your application a name (e.g. "Ionic OIDC")
* Change the **Base URI** and **Login redirect URI** to `http://localhost:8100` and click **Done**. 

After performing these steps, copy the `clientId` into `src/pages/login/login.ts` and change `{yourOktaDomain}` to match your account's id.

```typescript
constructor(private navCtrl: NavController, private oauthService: OAuthService) {
  oauthService.redirectUri = 'http://localhost:8100';
  oauthService.clientId = '{clientId}';
  oauthService.scope = 'openid profile email';
  oauthService.issuer = 'https://{youtOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default';
  oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new JwksValidationHandler();
  ...
}
```

Your OIDC app should have settings like the following:
